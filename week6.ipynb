The sulfur dioxide removal efficiency achieved, in most of the cases, is greater than 95%. The capital and operating costs of dry spray scrubbers technology range from 125–216 US$/KW for the former and 0.59–0.70 USc/kWh for the latter. Spray dry scrubbers in commercial use have achieved sulfur dioxide removal efficiency not greater than 90%. The method can be used for fuel with sulfur content up to 3.5%. The capital and operating costs are fairly low, ranging from 29–7.74 US$/kW for the former and 0.39–0.70USc/kWh for the latter. dry additive (ineffective for sulfur oxide removal) Such method achieves sulfur dioxide removal efficiency of 50% and can be used for fuels with sulfur content up to 1%. Regenerable processes generally require no waste disposal, produce little waste water, and have low sorbent makeup requirements. In most such systems, a pre-scrubber is essential to control chlorides. Although these processes can achieve high SO2 removal efficiencies (>95%), they have in general high capital costs and power consumption. The main influencing parameters regarding the capital cost are the flue gas flow rate as well as the quality and composition of the used fuel. In comparison to wet scrubbing systems, the capital cost is higher due to the extra regeneration units, which is in the range of 383–650 US$/kW. \")\n",
